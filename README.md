Project Title:Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Introduction:
This is a simple Java program for playing Tic-Tac-Toe. It allows two players to take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. Additionally,
the game includes an AI (Artificial Intelligence) player as one of the options for players, providing a challenge for those who want to compete against the computer.

How to Play:
Setup: Run the program.
Players: There are two players: Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O). Player 1 can be a human or AI player, while Player 2 is always human.
Game Board: The game board is a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid.
Winning: A player wins if they have three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
Draw: If all spaces on the board are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
Taking Turns: Players take turns making moves. Player 1 goes first, followed by Player 2.
Game End: The game ends when one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
